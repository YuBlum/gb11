theme: space

level shrink each time the player moves
              |
              |--> the player needs to get to the exit (puzzle?)

the player needs to scape a room (a scape room point-and-click game)



platformer?
top-down?
point-and-click?


script:
when everything
seems about to
colapse

when you look
around and all
you see are
corners

the feeling of
complete
claustrophobia
is what drives
you crazy

you need to get out

out of the madness
out of your head
out of this plane

but you can't...

but i can't...
